# Submitting Bug Reports
---
If you find something that doesn't work, please let us know. If you want it fixed, then we need to be able to reproduce it.  

### What to include:  
1) Start out by telling us what platform, python version & appjar version you are using. An easy way to find out is to run your code, from the command line, with the `-v` flag:
```
python demo.py -v
# this produces:
appJar: 0.94.0 Python: 2.7.10 TCL: 8.5, TK: 8.5 Platform: Darwin pid: 4048
locale: en_GB
```
2) Next, tell us what you are expecting to see happen, followed by what is happening.
3) Finally, give us a *small* piece of code, that when run, reproduces the bug you are experiencing.
